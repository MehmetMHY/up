# up

## About:
- The idea of "up" is that you run one script that will update/upgrade your operating system's main package manager(s) all at once.
- Now, every OS has a different package manager(s). So, there needs to be a different "up" for every OS.
- Currently, I support a very few list of packages for a small list of operating systems. But, I hope over time, that can change. 
- Quick History:
	- I started working on the "up" project back in 2019 when I was really getting into Linux. 
	- Back in 2019, I hated running so many commands just to update/upgrade all my packages. So, locally, I started the up project.
	- From 2019 to 2022, this project became more advance, cool, and useful. I started seeing how others might also see it as useful so I uploaded it to GitHub.
