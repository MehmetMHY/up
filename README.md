# up

## About:
- The idea of "up" is that you run one script that will update/upgrade your operating system's main package manager(s) all at once.
- Now, every OS has a different package manager(s). So, there needs to be a different "up" for every OS.
- Currently, I support a very few list of packages for a small list of operating systems. But, I hope over time, that can change. 

## Support On:
- Ubuntu
	- Packages:
		- Apt
		- Snap
- MacOS
	- Packages:
		- Homebrew

## Requires:
	- Unix Based System
	- Shell (Bash or Zsh)
